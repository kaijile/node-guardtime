TestData.txt - A plain text file for timestamping.
	Since text files have no provisions for
	embedded metadata, the timestamps are
	stored in separate files. In a practical
	integration scenario, it would be up to
	the host application to ensure they do
	not get lost or separated.
TestData.txt.gtts1 - An unextended timestamp for
	TestData.txt. Rename to TestData.txt.gtts
	to test verification using the standalone
	timstamping and verification tool.
TestData.txt.gtts2 - An extended timestamp for
	TestData.txt. Rename to TestData.txt.gtts
	to test verification using the standalone
	timstamping and verification tool.

TestData.png - A PNG image file for timestamping.
	Since PNG files can have embedded custom
	data, the integrators can decide if they
	want to embed the timestamps into the PNG
	files or keep them separate (for example,
	for consistency, if the same application
	also has to work with files that cannot
	embed custom metadata).
TestData.png.gtts1 - An unextended timestamp for
	TestData.png. Rename to TestData.png.gtts
	to test verification using the standalone
	timstamping and verification tool.
TestData.gtts1.png - The same image as in the file
	TestData.png, but with timestamp from the
	file TestData.png.gtts1 embedded in it.
TestData.png.gtts2 - An extended timestamp for
	TestData.png. Rename to TestData.png.gtts
	to test verification using the standalone
	timstamping and verification tool.
TestData.gtts2.png - The same image as in the file
	TestData.png, but with timestamp from the
	file TestData.png.gtts2 embedded in it.
